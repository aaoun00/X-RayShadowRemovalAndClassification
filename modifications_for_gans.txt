Added in morelayers for the encoding and decoding for the upscale
Increased the number of filter channels

November 25th
Will be removing the encoding layers so we now have only 4 convolution layers for the encoding where as before we had 7
In a format like below with self.gf = 32
    d1 = conv2d(d0, self.gf, bn=False)
    d2 = conv2d(d1, self.gf*2) #32
    d3 = conv2d(d2, self.gf*4) #64
    d4 = conv2d(d3, self.gf*8) #128
Adjusted the learning rate is 0.01
